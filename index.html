        <h2> Here are 7 things I learned from my Social Media and Content Creation class:</h2>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> 1. The first internet was the ARPANET </h2>
        <img src="Picture1.png">
        <p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/ARPANET">
        The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first public packet-switched computer network</a> 
        . It was first used in 1969, during the height of the Cold War. The U.S. military was interested in creating computer 
        networks that could continue to function after having portions removed, such as in the case of a nuclear strike and 
        universities wanted a network that recovers from failure over unreliable connections and shares data and resources 
        between users at different locations.</p>

        <h2> 2. Affordances</h2>
        <img src="Picture2.png">
        <p>According to UX researcher Don Norman ‚ÄúAn affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the 
        agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used." The internet is built atop our affordances. 
        For example, the original version of the internet was never meant to share cute animal photos. 
        However, we are capable of sharing cute animal photos and the internet supports my capability to do so.</p>

        <h2> 3. Making a blog is hard</h2>
        <img src="Picture3.png">
        <p> According to Don Norman, "Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor
            design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible." 
            I chose to make the website on Github and the blog entirely from html and css. End my suffering.
            <span style="font-size: 6px; font-family: 'comic sans ms'; color:red">My website can fall apart at any given moment.</span> 
            I should have used a website builder or existing website to host this blog. 
            There are so many features I did not know I needed. What I would give to drag and drop my images, or not know how to code.
        </p>

        <h2> 4. Philosophies and ethics shape technology</h2>
        <img src="Picture4.png">
        <p> The technology we create reflects the philosophies and ethics we live by. For example, Ubuntu is a Sub-Saharan African philosophy that focuses on the humanity through personal relationships with others and the belief that people are whole through their connections with others, not as individuals. Inspired by the philosophy was a free, open sourced, operating system, also named 
            <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about">Ubuntu</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Adult content shapes our technology</h2>
        <img src="Picture5.png">
        <p> According to <a href="https://archive.org/details/eroticengine0000bars/page/n9/mode/2up">
            The Erotic Engine by Patchen Barss</a>:
            <div style="position: relative; left: 50px; width: calc(90% - 50px); line-height: 2;"> If you use search engines like Google and Yahoo!, online retailers like Amazon and eBay, video- and photo-sharing sites like YouTube and Flickr, and many other integral components of modern media, you have benefit ted directly from [Adult content]'s influence both on the infrastructure of the Internet itself and on specific technological and business innovations</div>
        </p>
        <p> For example, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-miniplayer">YouTube added a feature in 2018</a> that lets users hover over videos for a preview, 
            a feature <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12856446">inspired by several preceding adult content websites before</a>. Nowadays, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1201889/most-visited-websites-worldwide-unique-visits/"> adult content websites remain some of the most popular websites to visit </a>, amongst search engines and social media.

        <h2>6. Self driving cars have different AI</h2>
        <img src="Picture6.png">
        <p>Remember when I said that the technologies created reflect the philosophies and ethics people live by? 
        It turns out that people have different lifestyles and the technology they create functions differently because of the difference in lifestyles.
        <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/24/139313">Karen Hao of MIT Technology Review<a> reports that in self driven cars, 
            countries like Japan heavily prioritize the pedestrian's survival over the passenger's survival. 
        However, in other countries like China, they prioritize the passenger's survival over the pedestrian's survival.</p>

        <h2>7. Content moderation is hard</h2>
        <img src="Picture7.png">
        <p>"One failure can incur enough public outrage to overshadow a million quiet successes."" - Tarleton Gillespie, Custodian's of the internet</p>
        <p> Who decides how content gets removed, filtered, or banned? Content moderation is based on the software and the current political contexts that surround their users. 
            For example, on Google maps, the border above Sevastopol is either blurred or hard drawn depending on where the user accesses the website. 
            <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-removing-sex-positive-accounts-without-warning/"> Other social media platforms censor their users that they previous allowed to make content freely </a>.
            Even as I use the free hosting on a public Github repo, I have to be mindful of my (hypothetical) users and not to offend them.
